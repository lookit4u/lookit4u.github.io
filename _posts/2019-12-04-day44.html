<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.2kg</h2>
<p>
  Today my wife is an evening worker, I have studies to go through, and I have to do cardio at home, if I have time I will also do strength training, most important to me is evening studies,
</p>
<p>
  Anyway tomorrow morning I can do some more serious workouts and then test my weight, it can be very helpful and maybe I can lose weight well before the weekend</p>
</p>
<p>
Good night.
