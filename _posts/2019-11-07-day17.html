and saw that I only lost 0.200kg which is very low but still it's progress and it's better than

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.6kg</h2>


<p>
  After finding out what my weight was this morning, I ate healthy and
  nutritious things for the rest of the day. I decided to remove the soy
  milk from the apple shake the night before, it seems to be quite a
  contributor to weight loss.
</p>

<p>
I returned to the house quite early, taking care of the house's needs.
Then I did a one-hour walk and then cardio workouts with a bunch of workouts
out of the Bar Brothers' system that included shoulder workouts and upper body
workouts, in each of the five sets I did a 6 minute cardio workout again to
maintain body heat.
</p>
<p>
The Bar Brothers workout was very difficult and the machine
time I took between set and set is about half a minute to 2
minutes which is quite a long time but I couldn't do any lower,
I expect to see good results tomorrow losing at least 93kg and it
will be really good for me.
</p>
<p>
After the workout, I ate two hard-boiled eggs, a tablespoon of sesame sauce,
and a tuna in the water, I had some salad from the afternoon, so I ate it too,
drank Wissotzky green tea, took a shower and went to bed.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is a new day and I hope to see a significant weight loss.
</p>
<p>
Good night.
