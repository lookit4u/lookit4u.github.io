title: "Day 25 - Bar Brothers Workout"
subtitle: "Exercise on this morning is excellent in my opinion,
although you do not eat in the morning should at least eat in the evening before bed so
that the body does not undergo hunger pressure or something similar"

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.4kg</h2>

<p>
Losing 0.300kg in weight, it's a slow progression but it's progress and I did a
test after doing sports in the morning, but I keep doing
the maximum to get better results
</p>
<p>
Next week I decided to change the menu again, in the
morning I will eat tuna with tomato sauce and two slices of cosmine bread,
which is great because it means I will not be hungry for at least 10 and that
is what I need, around 10 o'clock apple and tea, and at 12 and noon lunch
Complete with a carbohydrate-free salad.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, apple again with tea and before a fruit shake workout
followed by dinner with tuna and eggs, and a drink of tea, and all after a
workout that includes cardio and Bar Brothers
</p>


Good night.
