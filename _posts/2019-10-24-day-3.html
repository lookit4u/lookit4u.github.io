On that morning I went to do my business on the toilet, after that I took a shower check my weight on
the weight scale, I was able to lose weight again.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 96.1kg</h2>


<p>
I have to admit it's not like what I loss the day before, but it's still a significant weight lost,
as I said at the beginning, if I want to reach a 70K target in 30 days, I have to loss at least 0.8kg per day,
and if I went for 60 days long then I need to loss at least 0.4kg. At the moment it seems I am
progressing at a fast pace, although not uniform but such a fast I am satisfied.</p>

<p>
I'm not so sure it's healthy to lose weight so fast, I've read some articles on fast and uneven weight loss,
but listen, I eat properly, I don't feel hungry during
the day, and I feel really good when I get up in the morning, so right now I'm continuing in the same way.
