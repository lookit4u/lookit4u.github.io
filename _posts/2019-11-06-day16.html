<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.8kg</h2>


<p>
  The weight of 94.8kg is pretty much the weight I wanted to reach since the
   beginning of the week after last week I managed to reach 94.4kg and gained almost
  3kg last weekend.
</p>


<p>
  Now that I've managed to reach that weight and it's still midweek today,
  there may be a chance that I'll reach 93k at the end of the week, but it's probably
  not possible, but maybe I should eat healthier and lower my carbs.
</p>


<p>
  Next week I'm going to drop the only carbs I eat during the week and it's rice,
  which means I need to increase more protein, for example chicken, or tuna, or
  other fish, or eggs.
</p>


<p>
  In the evening I went for a 5km walk, it was really late and I was really
  tired, so when I came home and wanted to start cardio training he had no powers,
  so I ate tuna and soup, and then I went to sleep. We'll see what happens
  with me in the end.

Do not stop following my posts, tomorrow I upload photos.

<p>
  Good night.
</p>

<p>
Cheers!
