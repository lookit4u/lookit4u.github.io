title: "Day 9 - Bar Brothers Workout"
subtitle: "This is Day 9 since I started the Bar Brothers system training.
My goal in this program is divided into two: the first to lose weight to the desired weight,
the second to get in shape. In the beginning there was a serious weight loss that
included at least one kg every day. At the moment it seems to have stopped, but I'm not going to stop."

  The desired weight I want to reach is 70kg or 75kg. My height is 171 cm, which is 5.6102 feet,
  at the moment my weight is more or less as it is. I can't quite lose weight like I had at first,
  but what's important is not giving up.

After finishing workout yesterday I felt really good and I was sure that today I would consider 94,
anyways today a new day, took with me vegetable salad, rice and baked fish in the oven, new Chinese
tea I found at home, two fruits (apple and pear) and carrots I plan to eat during the day with A cup
of green Chinese tea.

In the evening I have a new workout that I haven't done yet that includes 5 rounds per set. Maybe
I'll do cardio tonight but not sure. In addition, my brother-in-law suggested that we go out to a
restaurant tonight, I told my wife that I could come on condition that we would leave after I finished
the workout and then there I would eat a salad with tuna and eggs.
