subtitle: "Day 15, after not doing an evening workout yesterday, I realized that
my weight had not dropped, but guess what, my weight had not increased since
yesterday. Which is excellent to me."

<p>
My weight stayed the same as yesterday and it is excellent, I did not have
the strength to exercise in the evening so I decided yesterday would be my day
of rest, today I have to do walking but not cardio because my legs still hurt.
Most important not to give up or retire no matter how long it takes, even though
I wanted to download as soon as possible, but my body didn't work that way.
At least not at this point.

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.2kg</h2>


<p>
  At the end of the evening I arrived home late and had no time to walk, I
  did a short cardio at home and started my Bar Brothers training focused on the shoulders,
  the training was
  harder than usual and I managed to do only half of it uniformly.
  <p>
  </p>
  I will do all the rest of the workout tomorrow with
  Bar Brothers Cardio and if it is time and early to go for a walk, anyway I hope my weight
  tomorrow will finally be 94kg, it's time to move on.
</p>

<p>
  Good night.
</p>

<p>
Cheers!
