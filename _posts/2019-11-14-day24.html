<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.7kg</h2>

<p>
  If you go over my old posts well, you will see that
  I have not yet reached the weight of 93, which is the first time I have weighed
  93kg since I started training, next week on Monday it will be a 4
  week cycle since I started Bar Brothers training,
  it is not easy But the results are not late.
</p>
<p>
If your weight stays stuck you have to think why. It usually happens that
the body is not ready to shed fats, when we do workout for over 20 minutes, once
the calories used by the body for energy are over, it starts to burn fats which is
actually what we want to get to.
</p>
<p>

Fat burning is the one that helps lose weight, because my work most of the time is in front of a computer, so I don't do too much exercise during the day, so evening training is very necessary for me.
</p>

<p>
When we get to a state that we are not losing weight it means no fat burning has
been done and if we have done evening workout before and have not lost weight
during sleep, it means one of the following:
</p>
<p>
1. Or we haven't trained enough, need to do some blood workouts and increase heart rate for
knitwear and it should last for more than twenty minutes, best half an hour or so, so I
would walk and do cardio afterwards.
</p>
<p>
2. The second option is that during the day the body is in hunger distress that we do not
relate to or that we are busy and not listening to the body's needs, in this
option even if we have done body workout will optimally try to preserve fats so
that he does not go into distress again.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I think this is the second option, sitting in front of a computer
during the day doing things that interest me, but even if I feel hungry
sometimes, I still continue because of the curiosity to do things other
than eat and soothe my belly, which probably keeps me from falling
continuously, So today I brought many vegetables to work eating them during
the day, for lunch I have enough vegetables to make myself a big salad,
I have chicken breast peas
and peas and carrots.
</p>


Good night.
