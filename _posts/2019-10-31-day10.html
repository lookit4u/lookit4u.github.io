<p>
  My body weight has been increasing since yesterday, I've gained about a pound, I'm not really happy but
  that's what it is, which I'm sure I'm not going to retire at this point. In the evening a massive workout
  awaits me and tomorrow I will do cardio training.

</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.8kg</h2>

<p>
Most important is not to forget to eat during the day, I have two fruits and today I will eat at a
place close to work, a salad with chicken breast and tahini (Sesame sauce).

</p>



<p>
Cheers!
