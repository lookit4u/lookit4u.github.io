  My body weight has been increasing since yesterday, I've gained about a pound, I'm not really happy but
  that's what it is, which I'm sure I'm not going to retire at this point. In the evening a massive workout
  awaits me and tomorrow I will do cardio training.

</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.8kg</h2>

<p>
Most important is not to forget to eat during the day, I have two fruits and today I will eat at a
place close to my work, a salad with chicken breast and tahini (Sesame sauce).

<p>
At the evening I went to walk and after I was back home I run into Bar Brothers workout which to day is
abs on bar, I must be honest with you, I was really hard to do this traning on the bar and not becouse,
of my abs, my shuldress was really hurt and although I done four set for every type of workout.

After I finish my workout I cleaning the house and I arranged everything to be ready for the weekend,
after that I showered up and wen for bad, tomorrow I will for workout and right after that,
I'll check my weight, good night.
