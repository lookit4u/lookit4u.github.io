<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.9kg</h2>
<p>
  So today I started with a breakfast that consisted of whole wheat
  bread, tuna, two eggs, and tahini, I must note that the tahini was salty to my taste, however
  I took a big salad today,
  prepared chicken breast, and of course peas and carrots,
  I continue to drink lots of tea during the day
</p>
<p>
  Going out for a walk in the evening was not easy,
  it was pretty cold, I went out with a long pants and a short shirt to
   keep my body warm, after I went back I headed for a not very small hill,
   and walked upstairs, went home and did some stress on the bar

As you can see I am going down fairly uniformly, my problem is weekends, another problem I have is that I am going down very slowly to my many hundreds of workouts, I have to deal with it, in my opinion eating more during the day can help.

<p>
  Bar Brothers training included a lot of cardio, with my biggest goal
  being to sweat in a crazy amount, that is how I feel about doing something,
  after which I ate tuna with eggs again, and I had an evening.

<p>
Good night.
