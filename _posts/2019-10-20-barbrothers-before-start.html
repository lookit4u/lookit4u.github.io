so, it's time to start with the Bar Brothers The System workout.
On every week they have some slogan which you need to keep in mind,
in that way we always remember what our goal and even if it defficault
and painful we will keep going on, like Eric Thomas once said:
"you are already in pain get a reward from it".

Please remember that at this moment, it is very difficult for me to bend over and do simple things, such as tying laces, picking up something that has fallen on the floor, Please remember that at this moment, it is very difficult for me to bend over and do simple things, such as tying laces, picking up something that has fallen on the floor, sitting on the ground, going up stairs, etc.

  <p>
Every day I am going to post about my progress as I said befor, I have some weekly work schedule showing my pace of progress and there I will right down my weight every day. I know it's not a smart  to check my weigh every day, usually we need to checking the weight once a week, but I've figured out how long it will take me to reach 70 kg, and if I lose 0.200 G every day, I'll be able to reach that weight after tree months. It's nice, but I want to have more weight loss, and it's very important for me to see the changes in my body every day.
</p>
  <p>
Also, please remember that you must change you feeding and make for yourself some diet menu. I done just that last week, I lean that you must keep your body comfortable, that is to have a feeling of satiety all the time, without feeling hungry. to achive that you must keep eating every tree or four hours, you must ridoff the sugar and bread. In my case I can eat no more than three fruits for a day, I must drink till to 3 liter of waters and I can eat many vegetables as I want.
</p>
  <p>
I can be sure that this diat will no be so simple, but it is posible to mange it and change it if I need, becouse again, the most important thing is to be satiety and not hungry. I think that in my case the sugar is my problem. I know that as more I will eat my body will born more calories, and I say it after all the articals I'v wes read before.
</p>
  <p>
Please keep to follow up my prograss
