subtitle: "Hi friends, today morning I saw that I was
successful, my weight at the beginning of this week already stands
at 94kg which is excellent. This week we will see if I reach 92k and
 if so then maybe in two weeks I will already reach 90kg. It all depends
  on what the week will be, as well as the pullup
attempts at this week's training."
