subtitle: "Hi friends, today morning I saw that I was
successful, my weight at the beginning of this week already stands
at 94kg which is excellent. This week we will see if I reach 92k and
 if so then maybe in two weeks I will already reach 90kg. It all depends
  on what the week will be, as well as the pullup
attempts at this week's training."

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.6kg</h2>

<p>
So today I was able to tall myself success, to come and reach such
weight as early as the week it is very encouraging. At first I thought I would
consider a lot at the beginning of the week,
but maybe that's how I can reach 92kg this weekend.

<p>
In the evening I was really hungry, but I stopped to rest at home anyway,
drank fruit smoothies, pear and dates with water. It was nice it kind
of woke me up but didn't really calm the hunger, after letting my girl sleep,
I decided to do sports at home anyway.
</p>
<p>
I started with the killer cardio I do every day, then I did Bar Brothers
Cardio training, and then I did what I wrote, reverse pullup, it was hard, I got
on the Bar and then I slowed down, the rate of decline was about 3 seconds. Between
each round, I waited 15 seconds. Each set contained 5 rounds and in total I made 3
sets which is 15 rounds.
</p>
<p>
It was hard and my arms hurt a lot after I finished, so I ate a tuna with tied eggs
and lots of tea. I took a shower and went to bed. Being hungry is not good. But what's
interesting is that I'm losing weight. Anyway that evening I did something extra.
</p>
<p>
I made green pork with garlic and onion and added 8 almonds to it, today I will eat
it at noon, I tasted it yesterday and it was delicious, I will take two fruits and
green tea tomorrow, I really hope to reach a weight of 92kg this weekend.
</p>
<p>

From what it looks like my body realizes that I am in a state of decline and that I
am not going to stop and therefore it seems to me that the body is adapting itself to
the situation. Once someone told me that if I want to make some change in life and I know
what ways I should make the change, I have to follow those ways for 40 days, then it will
be easier and the change will be clearer.
</p>
<p>
So this is a two year old friends, I am on the road to change and this is the 20th day and
I think my body understands this and is now shedding more than 0.2kg every day.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
