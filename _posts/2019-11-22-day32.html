<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 92.9kg</h2>
<p>
  It's about losing more than a pound, it's great, but in the morning I woke up weak, ate rice with tuna and drank tea with 150m of yogurt.
</p>
<p>
  Today if I have the time to do combined leg training and torso, I have many things to do today, my wife is working and I don't have that time to extend this post.
</p>
<p>
  Hoping to see a big weight loss again after the weekend, at this time it is only half a pound from last week.
</p>
<p>
Good night.
