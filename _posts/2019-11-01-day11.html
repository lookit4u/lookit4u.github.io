  On the morning I dressup for workout and start with Jumping Jacks and Jumping Lunges, after that I done
  Explosive Sprints, every rotain I done 10 times for Jumping Jacks and Jumping Lunges, on the spring I struggled
  only three times.

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.4kg</h2>

My weight has finally reached the direction of 94K, which is very gratifying, since maybe I will stop walking
every day at evening and start doing more cardio before training, I decided to do so just for this week and
see what the results will be next weekend. My goal for next weekend will be 92kg, I hope I can reach that goal.
True, I have to lose 0.800kg every day so that after a month I'll be in the 70kg area, but at least I'm
losing 2kg a week,which are alot for me.

After the workout I took pictures, it is true that no special progress is seen but I feel the progress
and it will soon be seen outward.
