<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.6kg</h2>

<p>
So far I am still of the opinion that if I cannot lose weight following
fasting then at least I can eat properly, I do the necessary sports and rest
needed for my body to develop properly.
</p>
<p>
All my work day is office on a computer, so I don't really move much,
but two days ago I did walking and cardio at home, my legs hurt a lot, so I decided to give myself time to recover.
</p>
<p>
Instead of cardio I do abdominal workouts on the floor with a leg movement, I don't really sweat it, but it's really hard to do that. The best thing is to do a walk, but I feel you need to rest for at least a few days.
</p>
<p>
The whole idea is to check how much I am going to weigh in on a weekend and how much I have lost, yes I want to reach a weight of 93 point something ... but I have to make sure I feel good so I can continue to exercise. If I don't have foot pain on Thursday, I'll go for a walk, and I hope to see a significant improvement this Friday.
</p>
<p>
Good night.
