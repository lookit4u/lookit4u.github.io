if I managed to drop 7KG since I started, then it is interesting how much I
will consider 40 days ood ie on the eighties since I started,
and bodybuilding is equally important."

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.3kg</h2>
<p>
  Losing a pound without doing a workout, for me, is a success, it means my body has become accustomed to a certain status, which means I lose weight every moment, even if I don't exercise, it's important to remember that you still need to do at least 3 times a week.

  Today I ate goose with tuna and drank lots of tea. I also had an apple with yogurt and in the evening I will make training harder than yesterday. Hopefully in the morning we will see a significant improvement again, I want to reach 90 KG but it is not really feasible for the coming weekend. But I'm sure I'll reach that weight in two weeks.<p>

Good night.
