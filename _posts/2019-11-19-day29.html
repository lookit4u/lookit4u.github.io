<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.6kg</h2>
<p>
Today's Bar Brothers workout includes upper body workout and especially for the arms, in addition to the workout I set myself is cardio workout and because of the ankle pain since yesterday, I decided to do the cardio on the ground, meaning the same movements just lying down,
</p>
<p>
Each set will contain 20 seconds and four sets per exercise, after half an hour or 40 minutes I did the Bar Brothers workout, plus doing a pullup with auxiliary cable, I have a black auxiliary cable at home and used it yesterday and I did feel it was quite helpful and yet I felt effortless Unusual and that's what I do today.
</p>
<p>
At the food level, I couldn't make chicken breast yesterday, I took a big salad and tuna, two apples and probably tea, I also have 0% fat yogurt, I realized that these yogurts make up the appetite, so maybe I could close for lunch.

As you can see from the pictures there may have been a slight improvement in my back and a clear change since I started, so that we can see this change better I decided to bring the pictures back from the beginning in this post, you can see a difference, it is not great but it is also progress.

Tonight I continued as much as I could and hope to see weight loss again tomorrow, I thank everyone who reads these posts and thank Lazar and Dawson for clearly instructing how to do every day training from the three months
