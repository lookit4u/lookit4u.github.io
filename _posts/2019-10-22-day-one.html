I am so excited to get start the Bar Brothers routine. It's 90% clear to me that this
program will work, of course it requires me to follow Lazar and Dusan rules, but like
any other person, I think that I will have unexpected things on the weeks routine.
I'm going to tell you every day what I did and what I ate. It is important to remember
that I will not detail the daily practice of bar brothers. If you want to know it
you will need to purchase it and I invite you to do so. But if you're curious like me
and just want to know if it really works, feel free to follow my posts every day as
I write on the Loot It For You website.

The rules that I go to work every day are as follow, every day in the morning you have
to take your body weight and record it in a follow-up table. Of course there is important
thing you must to remember. First, you must empty your bladder befor you step on the weight scale.
Your real weight will be show up only after you "dropped down your package on the toilet".
Second weight yourself naked or in your underwear. In that way we do not include the
weight of our clothes.

Every day I will take a five miles walking distance, after I will get back
home I will start to Bar Brothers workout, this is way I buy some bar and dip machine
to my home. If it will be not rining outside, I will take my workout on the traning park
that I have neer to my house.

<p>
Becouse today is my first day workout and I didnt write down my weight I take the weight
befor the workout, but I suggest to wwrite your body weight at the morning as I already
write above. so my weight for today are <b>98.3kg</b> which is now what I expected, I
thought my weight would be lower, so I'm going to have to work really hard.
</p>

<p>
As I promised, I ran 5km (which is 3 miles), 2.5km away from home, and another 2.5km
back home, after that I run into Bar Brothers workout, which was realy hard for me, but
<b>no pain no gain</b>, so I think it's good for me as begginer.

After I finish out the routine for to day, I took the following pictures.

<b>summary:</b> for day one It was hard for me to do these workouts, but I feel good.
After I finish my workout at that evening I ate two hard-boiled eggs with low sodium
tuna and two teaspoons of sesame sauce. It was pretty tasty mainly because I was
hungry, plus I drank three glasses of water and immediately showered and went to bed.
