<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.7kg</h2>

<p>
  If you go over my old posts well, you will see that
  I have not yet reached the weight of 93, which is the first time I have weighed
  93kg since I started training, next week on Monday it will be a 4
  week cycle since I started Bar Brothers training,
  it is not easy But the results are not late.

  Today I took food, lots of food, that includes rich salad, peas and carrots,
  and chicken breast, of course two fruits, in my case it is pears, and tea,
  from the morning I am only on tea, I ate 0% yogurt in
  the morning, and since then I drink a lot,
