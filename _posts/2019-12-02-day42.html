<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.1kg</h2>
<p>
The truth is that I thought I would lose weight last weekend a lot more than I gained. But getting to the previous weight this weekend is 91.4 or reaching less weight, surely it will be harder, my wife says to do more walking and so I'll be back for it.
</p>
<p>
Tonight I did combined body workouts, that included cardio and body part on it, the truth was that I was pretty tired and felt weak and didn't have the strength to do the workout, but I did stress on the bar and also pullup and managed to get more than half, for me it's progress.

Good night.
