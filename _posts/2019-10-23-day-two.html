After I finish my first routine, I felt exhausted but none the less, it was really good start for me.
On day two I want to see how far can I go with Bar Brothers workouts, in their work plan they note that
you can choose how much sets you going to do and in my case it's between three to four rounds.
</p>

<p>
After I finish my 5km walk I start the second day routine. It was pretty easy for me to go for four rounds,
I felt realy exhausted but I manege to do so. For me done pushup is not so eazy but if every set contain less
repeat, it can do so. I think that it's good idea that Dusan and Lazar guide us do so in that way, because right
now it is the stage of gaining strength in the body, especially after I have not done sports for a number
of years in my case.

<p>
If you remember, my weight for yersteday was 98.3kg, on this morning I check out my weigh again and
guess how much the weight scale showed me?
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 96.8kg</h2>

<p>
Do you believe? that's more than a 1 kg of weight loss overnight, the truth is that if you think about it then
it is inaccurate, since I considered my self weight at the night before I started workout, so it doesn't
really indicate my true weight before, but I'm happy with it anyway. At least a good enough in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
I photographed myself again,there is no much chainging as you can  see, but I want to make at the
end of my journey, video the will incluse every day to see the changes in weight loss, which I
think going to be very cool.

<p>
After I finish this day workout I ate two hard-boiled eggs with low sodium
tuna and two teaspoons of sesame sauce, and two cups of water, after that I went to bad, let's check
what will be my weight tomorrow.

<p>
Cheers!
