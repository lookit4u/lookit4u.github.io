<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.0kg</h2>




<p>
My weight did not reach 93 kg, but I managed to reach a new weight that is not marked in
my weight table. Now weekend and usually weekend I gain some weight, what
it takes is to be careful about what I eat.

<p>
I really hope that at the beginning of the week I will reach the
 weight I mentioned, it will help me a lot. Anyway, I figured out
 how I could change or reduce or add foods to my menu without hurting
 my alertness and giving my whole body what it needed, while still
 helping it shed as much weight as possible.
</p>

<p>
I decided to lower the carbohydrates, until today I ate rice at noon,
now I'm going to eat legumes with healthier values ​​such as peas and carrots, green beans,
and of course a large vegetable salad, I have two fruits to eat during the day and drink
lots of tea.
</p>

<p>
Progress is good at both the weight and the training level. In the evening
I ate chicken and salad, tomorrow's day is a rest day to give the body a rest
from the harsh days that have been so far.
</p>

<p>
In the morning I had some sweet food with my wife in the restaurant, but still it
did not affect me so much. I did the walk I mentioned earlier.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
