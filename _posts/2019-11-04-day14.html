time so I only did half cardio training which included 15 minutes and then I gained
weight, guess what the results were"

<p>
The results were really good, and just what I expected, that's exactly what happened last
Friday, I did morning workouts and my weight dropped a lot
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.2kg</h2>


<p>

  In the evening I went for a walk and after returning to cardio training again,
  this time I tried to be as full as possible, after I finished I started Bar Brothers
  training focused on the shoulders, it was not easy either.
<p>
</p>
  After I finished, I sat down to eat, and gave my body what it needed, as
  usual dinner consisted of two hard-boiled eggs, tuna, and a spoonful of Sesame sauce.
  I drank a lot of water again and immediately after that I went to bed.
  <p>
  </p>

  Tomorrow we will see what the results will be, I expect to see at least 94kg results.
</p>

<p>
  Good night.
</p>

<p>
Cheers!
