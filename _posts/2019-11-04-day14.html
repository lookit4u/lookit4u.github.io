time so I only did half cardio training which included 15 minutes and then I gained
weight, guess what the results were"

The results were really good, and just what I expected, that's exactly what happened last
Friday, I did morning workouts and my weight dropped a lot.
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.2kg</h2>


<p>
  Today is a rest day for me, I feel leg pain and I know I need rest. It's important
  to listen to the body, to give everything in order to succeed is important, but you
  have to know when to let go so that I can move forward faster afterwards.
<p>
</p>
  In the evening I ate vegetable soup (the soup did not include potatoes),
  ate two bowls of soup and drank sparkling water. After I went to bed early,
  I was really tired from this day, I think it's mostly thanks to
  morning workouts.

  Tomorrow we will see what the results will be, I expect to see at least 94kg results.
</p>

<p>
  Good night.
</p>

<p>
Cheers!
