<p>
  Today I ate a big salad with tuna, split the salad in two, ate two apples, each with a whole meal, and one yogurt. In general, she was thoughtful of satiety, I felt good and drank lots of tea.
</p>
<p>
  In the evening I did a workout for the lower body, for the core that is ABS and shoulders, I started with cardio to do body warming and I did well in all the other exercises I did, hoping to see very positive results over the weekend.</p>
</p>
<p>
    wish me luck.

<p>
Good night.
