<h3 class="section-heading">Bar Brothers in RUSSIA</h3>
<p>
  I search in every site that I can find on google, and I found more than video that I thought.
  The first video is from BAR BROTHERS RUSSIA. In the video there is two guys who at the first look skiny,
  but after one year they made the change, and you are can be sure that it was tough year, you can see
  the most of their workout, and I must agree that look difficult, but none of the less, it isen't impossible,
  I can surlly tell you that this vidio are realy motivated.
</p>
  <p>
    On the comment of this video I found mainly
  commants that say it's impossible to make this transformation in one year. It's really important
  to say, all people judge by themselves. If they could not achive the same goal that was presented (in our case
  full body transformation on one year only!) then no one can do so,  but I do not blame them for this.
  the relpay commant of Bar Brothers Russia
  was as follow:
</p>
<p>
  They will always say that you can not collect 8-12 kg of muscle mass per year. It's just that I'm always
  interested. How do you know how my metabolism works? In the video, everything can not be transferred.
  We practiced for 2-3 hours. And we did not just do pull-ups and push-ups every day. We had a strict training system. I also liked the way you defined the age from the photo. It just so happened that a more recent photo of a bad form was not. I had to take an earlier photo. Our weights: 67kg (2016 summer) -81 (2017 autumn) 55kg (2016 summer) -66kg (2017 autumn). I'm almost sure that you can not be persuaded. we shot this video is not for deception. Believe it or not you decide, but I think I've brought enough arguments in my direction.

<h3 class="section-heading">The story of Dale Merriam</h3>
<p>
  In this video you can find  the story of Dale Merriam, he grow up very skiny, he was live unhealthy lifestyle,
  drink alcohol and ended up in prison several times. One day he came across some Bar Brothers video and join
  the movment. on the video you can see his three years of transformation that Merriam start on age 35 up to 38.
  I was thinking about that, three years is a long time, but give up on that transformation is worse. This video give
  me a clue that if I will going on that path it will take no so short time, but be honest, this is worth it.

<h3 class="section-heading">Ber Brothers Website</h3>
<p>
  Very easy to use Bar Brothers website, they display all the important things.
  Before they even start moving with you on the system, they have a number of videos
  that are important to watch, in each video they show how to do the exercises most
  effectively for the same muscle you are working on.
</p>
<p>
  Usually Dusan explains what exactly to do on each weekday,
  and Lazar presents the exercises. Another thing, every day you have different
  training on a different muscle group, in the whole system you will not see too much
  repetitive training, the training on muscle group changes as you progress in
  the Bar Brothers system.
</p>

<p>
  The best way to get results is with the tables and explanations of the Bar Brothers
  diet, if you incorporate the diet including training you can achieve better results
  in a short time, most importantly in the diet paying attention to your body's needs,
  the body must not be hungry during training days.
</p>
<p>
  It is also important to remember that the system is spread over three months,
  after three months you can produce the video of before and after. Most importantly,
  stick to the system plan, in this way the results of changing their body shape will
  be more effective. Also, every week you have a quote that Dusan and Lazar present,
  their goal is to remember that you are capable of doing the body transformation as you
  dream.
</p>
<p>
  It's important to remember that the process is difficult and there will be days that
  are very early, but remember your goal at the end of the process, it will pay off!
  Have lots of success.
</p>
<p>
  for life
