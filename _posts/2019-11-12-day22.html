subtitle: "I didn't work out yesterday because it was late and I didn't have food
at home either. It is not advisable to do hard workouts if there is no food, but

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.0kg</h2>

<p>
At least my weight looks like it is, but the problem is that I have no food
for today, so I'll probably go eat today at work and in the evening do some shopping
that will only include some because of vegetables,
tuna, eggs, yogurt and cheese.
</p>
<p>
It's important to remember that this week I don't eat carbs food
no matter what. So I also have to cook peas and carrots to have for the rest of the
week. Yesterday I ate green beans but I had stomach pains in the evening, I guess I
had to soak the green beans in the water before cooking.

<p>
In the evening I did cardio training, some ABS training from Bar
Brothers training and then did reverse pullup just like I did the day before,
it was just as hard as yesterday
but I managed to finish three sets successfully
</p>

<p>
After the workout, I made two hard-boiled eggs and tuna in the water,
this time adding tomato sauce with eggplant instead of the grinding. The truth seems to me that
the grinding I had was spoiled and so I made the change,
I must point out that the food after the workout is very tasty!
</p>
<p>
Good night.
