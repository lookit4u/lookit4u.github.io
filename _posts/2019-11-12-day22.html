subtitle: "I didn't work out yesterday because it was late and I didn't have food
at home either. It is not advisable to do hard workouts if there is no food, but

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.0kg</h2>

<p>
At least my weight looks like it is, but the problem is that I have no food
for today, so I'll probably go eat today at work and in the evening do some shopping
that will only include some because of vegetables,
tuna, eggs, yogurt and cheese.
</p>
<p>
It's important to remember that this week I don't need carbs
no matter what. So I also have to cook peas and carrots to have for the rest of the
week. Yesterday I ate green beans but I had stomach pains in the evening, I guess I
had to soak the green beans in the water before cooking.

<p>
Good night.
