Hi guys, so I have to admit I made a mistake, it was a long weekend, and I wanted to enjoy life a bit,
but then I fell for sweet foods and felt just like in Sin City, I also ate bread which is really not
good for my diet.
</p>
<p>
After that, I decided in the evening to do a 5km walk, but in the end it was raining in the evening and
couldn't get outside, so I checked the Bar Brothers table and decided to do cardio training at home,
which was indeed difficult.

<p>
I must point out that I checked my weight before, which was not good, my weight was 97.6kg which is a
lot to verify what I lose because I must not forget that I was 94.1kg.
</p>

<p>
So I did the Bar Brothers cardio workout, of course it was long and I also doubled sets and reps,
then I really felt good and got on the weight meter.
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 96.8kg</h2>


<p>
That number is good, but it's not enough, mainly because of the weight I've been. tomorrow I will
workout outside, go for a walk, of course if it does not rain, if it rains I will have to do cardio
at home. I think I'll double the training again, I want to see a clearer result tomorrow.
</p>


<p>
Cheers!
