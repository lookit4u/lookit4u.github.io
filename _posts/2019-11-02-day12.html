  The morning after I also ate rice, fish, and many salads at noon,
  I also ate black bread and hummus, and how not, in the evening I expected a
  surprise, weighed myself before training and it was hard to see what I saw,
  my weight was 97.6kg, I really exaggerated this weekend, so I decided to do a
  murderous training.
</p>


<p>
In the evening I did a 5km walk, then did cardio at home was quite difficult and sweated a lot,
then I did Bar Brothers training for the back, and the training included a lot of work on the Bar.
The last workout was pullup hold side to side, and because I'm so fat and still unable to do one
full pullup, I did this workout on the ground like they do in a pushup.
</p>

<p>
After the workout I checked my weight and it would have looked much better, it is not
yet 94.4 and I am about to reach that weight max tomorrow or at least in two days
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 96.0kg</h2>

<p>
The new weight, of course, is not the ideal weight, but at least that is the direction,
if I can lose another 1.6kg today then tomorrow I will be 94.4kg which is excellent, the
last workout I did on 31.11 was in the morning and he really helped me, maybe I will
do such training again This morning we will see what the situation will be.
