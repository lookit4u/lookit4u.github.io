This is day number 6 of my traning, I woke up early because they moved the clock to a winter clock,
I didn't have too much to do, so I decided to weight myself before eating something in the morning.
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 96.3kg</h2>


<p>
I think this weight is pretty good, considering that last Wednesday I weighed exactly the same
weight. I can take that in the direction of frustration but must continue the training program
and must never give up even when difficult, as Eric Thomas says: <b>pain is temporary if you
  quit however it will last forever.</b>
</p>


<p>
The truth is, when I think about it, Eric Thomas has another good sentence when he wants
something that gives him the ambition to conquer our goals. For example:<b>
You can't sleep. Broke people sleep. You got to be willing to sacrifice sleep, if you sleep you may miss the
opportunity to be successful.
</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying it's simple to do what Eric Thomas says, but it's important to remember, for example,
if there is something that excites us, we will continue to deal with it even if we are tired or hungry.
And in my opinion that's what Eric Thomas means, referring to the process of what we want to accomplish
with excitement. In this way we will continue to work towards achieving the goal.

I arrived at the house around 8:30 pm, it's because I came back late and also did some shopping and
bought some food for the rest of my diet. Then I started doing a workout according to Bar Brothers tables,
of course I started walk 5km as always and then I added cardio training even though I didn't have to do so,
but it's important to me to see results fast.

<span class="caption text-muted">I quit the Gym, I done cardio outside</span>


<p>
Then I started that day's training, was listed on the Bar Brothers tables to do abs workouts,
and after I finished, I took a shower and sat down to eat. I've eaten what I always eat after
training, Sesame sauce with tuna and two eggs, let's me write you how to make the tahini from Sesame sauce,
it's very tasty.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Ingredients:</b><br>
  1 cup of sesame sauce<br>
  2 crushed garlic cloves<br>
  3/4 cup of cold water<br>
  1/2 lemon squeezed medium<br>
  1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
  1/2 cup chopped parsley (not must)<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>preparation method:</b>  <br>
Mix all ingredients in a bowl. Keep in the fridge.<br>
The tahini can be accredited by adding a little tahini or diluting by adding a little water.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Tomorrow I will reconsider and see if today's effort was worth it, I expect to lose at least 0.800kg
  of my weight.<br>
Cheers!
