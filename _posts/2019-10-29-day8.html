subtitle: "I woke up really early this morning, got on the weight gauge and saw
that today I hadn't lost weight, it's time to think whether or not losing weight is a problem or not."

  I won't lie, I was a little disappointed to see that I couldn't lose weight from yesterday to today,
  indeed it is not wise to measure your weight every day, but I really wanted to see the changes, like a
  little research on my body.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.5kg</h2>


<p>

  Like I said yesterday, the workout I did was very massive and focused mainly on the chest. And I didn't do
  cardio like I did two days ago, it might have an effect, but if my muscle mass increased and then my body
  weight increased then I think it's fine.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, I feel good and not too hungry, which is already good, and besides, I gained weight only 0.200kg
  so I guess it's really okay to see a slight increase every once in awhile, but that means that I'm not sure I'll
  reach 91.8kg this weekend.

  At the moment, despite the slight weight gain it still seems to be declining, for me it is excellent.
  The Bar Brothers program does help me lose weight and their diet plan helps me stay calm and not hungry.

  Maybe in the future I might make a video of the body change with the pictures I take every few days.
  Sometimes there are days that are very late and I'm tired  so I forget to take pictures of myself.
  But I have quite a lot of pictures to make a video showing my body transformation.
