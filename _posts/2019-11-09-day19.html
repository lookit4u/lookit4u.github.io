to stay less than 96 K, now you can say that the training is paying off,

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.9kg</h2>

<p>
The success of Laischer's low weight of 96kg, for me, is excellent, it is not a slight
increase in weight, but still, it is progress since after each week I increased to 97kg
after the weekend.
</p>
<p>
I decided this week in addition to the carbohydrate to do every day pullup
at the bar, I do not know if I told but Pullup training I can not do until
the end, to do a full pullup increase I have to practice reverse, ie to be
in fullpullup position and then slow down, if successful Slowing down means
that I can do a full pullup at least once. This week I'm going to do this
workout every day.
</p>
<p>
Then, i.e. after the next week I will check next week if I can do a full
Pullup to the end, and then see where my training has progressed.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
