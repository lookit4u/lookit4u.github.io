<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.8kg</h2>
<p>
  I'm proud of today's weight which is less than 94kg which is really good for me. Of course there is always room for improvement and reduction but it is good at the moment.
</p>
<p>
  Tonight I arrived at the house very late and could not do any training. I ate cosmine flour with tuna and two eggs and drank tea most of the day. Plus I ate an apple and it kept me going all day.
</p>
<p>
  In the evening I ate tuna with red rice. The truth is I'm afraid my weight will rise in the morning but I had to bring nutritious food into my body. I didn't have salads because I was traveling most of the day so I ate sandwiches</p>
<p>
Good night.
