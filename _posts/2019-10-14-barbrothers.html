<p>In 2015 when I learn over the nigth to some exam that I hade to do,
  I cross over the internet with some website that present the movment of
  Bar Brothers. On the short video that was play on my screen, Dosun (that was the presentor
  of that video) present him story about his life and search for changing his life,
  He tells the story a little sadly, about how day after day haunted
   and he tried to make sense of the things that were going on in
    his life.
</p>
<p>
He later explains how he knew Lazar, a Serbian guy who was clear in his
 mind, with confidence and a shapely, chiseled body. When he asked him
  how he managed to get his body to such a level of shape, he explained
   that what he usually does if not the only one is the use of a bar,
    which the exercises he performs are a pullup.
</p>

<p>
He goes on to add in the details, noting that he started working with
 Lazar on serious body tapping that included mostly street workouts
  known as calisthenics, and from there they just grew, creating the
  bar brothers movement and uploading videos online for articles on
   how to do things right from a non-existent point of view Having
    to sign up for a gym, you can only transform your body using
     calisthenics when using weight is done by body weight itself.
   </p>

   <p>

After seeing the video I felt that it made a lot of sense what Dosun
 pointed out, doing safe body workouts can bring results, but I couldn't
  ignore the fact that he said "you have to take yourself seriously if
   you want to take this program" Not suitable for anyone.
 </p>

 <p>
To take this program and succeed you must be clear in your mind with
 clear goals and objectives and not move away from it, it reminded me
  of the "secret" to those who are unfamiliar with this full-length
   video that shows about "gravity" and how it makes a significant
    impact on our life, in principle Based on a computer and a desire,
     the more powerful the thought and the will, the more likely you
      are to conquer the goals you set for yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
In those days I bought the Bar Brothers program but I didn't really
 do anything about it, lately I decided to change access and go all
  over the box office, at the same time I was single and today I am
   33 plus married girl, it will probably be harder than I could have
    done when I was single, But that's what makes it more challenging.
  </p>

  <p>
I intend to post posts on the whole topic and showcase my progress and
 results so that others can be impressed with the program as I was
  impressed. It's clear to me that it won't be easy, but I know I must
   not give up and this time I have to go with it to the end.
 </p>

 <p>
I will build myself a menu as well as present it to anyone interested
 in doing exactly the steps I intend to take and seeing success as well.
  It's important to remember that all those young people can probably
   make the change. The difficulty is for older people, in these posts
    it is important for me to emphasize that no matter what age,
     success in health can be achieved mainly in changing body shape.
   </p>

   <p>
wish me luck.

See you in the next post.
