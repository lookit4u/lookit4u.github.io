<p>In 2015 when I was learn over the nigth to some exam that I hade to do,
  I cross over the internet with some website that present the movment of
  Bar Brothers. On the short video that was play on my screen, Dusan (that was the presentor
  of that video) presented him story about his life and search for changing his life,
  He tells the story that gives you the feeling of being rising from the darkness of life,
  about how day haunted day and he tried to make sense of the things that were going on his life.

<p>
He later explains how he knew Lazar, a Serbian guy who was clear in his
 mind, with confidence in mind and a incredible body shape. When he asked him
  how he managed to get his body to such a level of shape, he explained
   that what he usually does, if not the only one, is the use of a bar,
    which used for pullup exercises.

<p>
He goes on and explained in more details, since that he started working with
 Lazar and exercises, which included mostly street workouts
  known as calisthenics, from there they just grew, creating the
  Bar Brothers movement and uploading videos online, articles and tips
   how to do things right and exercises at home or use public exercise machines without having
    to sign up for a gym. In that way, Dusan explained, you can transform your body using
     only calisthenics, and it's done by using your body weight, and there is no better way to
     exercise your body then use your own body weight.
   </p>

   <p>

After seeing the video I felt that it made a lot of sense what Dusan
 pointed out, doing exercise by using body weight workout can bring results, but I couldn't
  ignore the fact that he said "you have to take yourself seriously if
   you want to take this program" which is mean that this program not suitable for anyone.

 <p>
To take this program and succeed you must be clear in your mind with
 clear goals and targets and get stick on it and not give up even if it's difficult, it reminded me
  some movie from 2006 called "The Secret", to those who are unfamiliar with this full-length
   video that shows about "Law of Attraction" and how it makes a significant
    impact on our life, in principle based on a mind thinking and a feelings,
     which can be really powerful if you have some will to achive some targets,
     and if you will stick on your goal in mind is't more likely you be able to conquer your goals.

    <p>
In those days I bought the Bar Brothers program but I didn't really
 do anything about it, lately I decided to change my mind and make my first
 step for life changing with that Bar Brothers program. At the time when
 I whatch the Bar Brothers on the first time I was a single and today I am
 33 plus married and have a babygirl. it will probably be harder than I could have
 done when I was single, but that's what makes it more challenging.
  </p>

  <p>
I intend to post here and showing my progress and results, and more important,
befor and after images and the difference between them, so that others can be
impressed with the program as I was. It's clear to me that it won't be easy,
but I know that I must not give up and this time I have to go with it till the end.
 </p>

 <p>
I will build myself a menu as well present it here for anyone interested
 in doing exactly the steps I intend to take and seeing success as well.
  It's important to remember that all those young people can probably
   make the change. The difficulty is for older people, like myself, in these posts
    it is important for me to emphasize that no matter what age you are,
     success in health can be achieved mainly in changing mind and body shape.
   </p>

   <p>
wish me luck.

See you in the next post.
