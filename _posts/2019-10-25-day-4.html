On the morning before I ate or dome somthing else I get up on my weight scale! and this time it was
a good feeling, because I lose weight, lot of this time, I can tell you that I am proud of myself
and proud that I decided to take the Bar Brothers program.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.9kg</h2>


<p>
Today I can't do workout becouse I have no time, hopefully tomorrow I can practice again,
it's important to remember the goal I set for myself. I'm weighing 70kg in a month,
I did a calculation and for that I need to lose weight more than 26K and again, every day I
have to lose 0.8Kg. I will elaborate on that later.
</p>

<p>
It is important for me to emphasize that I work with a tidy table in my room and that is how I
record my weight every day and what exercise I did, when you see the goal in front of your eyes
every day it helps to focus on it.

<span class="caption text-muted">Focus on your targets</span>

<p>
I didn't take pictures today because like I said I don't have that much time but later I will take
some more pictures to see the progress and changes in the body.

Cheers!
