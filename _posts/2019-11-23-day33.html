<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 92.9kg</h2>
<p>
  I already know I'm going to gain a lot of weight, maybe three pounds or more, my dad has a birthday and we're going to celebrate him tonight, I know we'll eat lots and lots of sweet and fat foods if I don't come back late, but if I come back late I'll post workout for the day Sunday evening.
</p>
<p>
  At least my weight reached 92 pounds, it's not exactly what I wanted but it's progress, you could say it's slow, but still progress and very soon I will have the dream body I always wanted to have, with hard work to achieve.
</p>
<p>
  This week I'm going to eat mostly salads and tuna in the water (instead of tuna in oil) in the evening after training both tuna with two eggs. It really helps after training as I have known in previous weeks.
</p>
<p>
  wish me luck.

<p>
Good night.
