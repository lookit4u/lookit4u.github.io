title: "Day 39 - Bar Brothers Workout"
subtitle: "So at the beginning of the week there was a slight decrease,
and then I stayed for days on the same weight, guess what, I'm on the same weight again,
it's very interesting why it happens."

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 91.4kg</h2>
<p>
  This morning I got up early and went for a sport, which included walking with all kinds of upper body exercises, the difficulty was heavy but I didn't give up.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the workout I did cardio and other strength training, I was really exhausted and then I showered and went to empty myself in the bathroom, then I gained weight and then saw the wonderful drop this week, that's a drop more than his caliber from last weekend and it's great. That means there is a change, and here is the 40th day of training.
</p>
<p>
Good night.
