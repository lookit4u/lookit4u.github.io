title: "Day 13 - Bar Brothers Workout"
subtitle: "Today I brought a rice and big salad with chicken from the previous weekend, I have
two fruits and during the day I drank tea. The feeling was really good. I went down in my
stomach which mean the extent of my stomach dropped down, but I will only check it out at the end of the first 4 weeks"

So today I ate slad and hips of chicken, I had green tea that I drank doring the day, my weight
was the same as the last day, so doring the night I didn't lose weight, It's pretty frustrating that
I can't go down. In the morning I wanted to do some training before going to work but I couldn't
get up because I woke up too late, so I went to work and just in the evening I started training.

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 96.0kg</h2>


<p>
My evening workout included the things I usually do, a quick walk and regular Bar Brothers
workout focused on the lower body, plus I did cardio for 25 minutes, it was hard and my
legs hurt but during exercise I saw my vision and then the difficulty was reduced.

<p>
  After finishing tuna with two hard-boiled eggs and a spoonful of sesame sauce,
  I drank a lot of water and felt tired. Tomorrow morning if I can get up early I will
  practice cardio before work and only after that will I consider myself.
</p>
<p>
  Good night.

<p>
Cheers!
