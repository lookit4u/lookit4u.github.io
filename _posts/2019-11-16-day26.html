<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.6kg</h2>

<p>
Weight gain happened because last night I ate well, although I tried to eat
allowed things but ate black
bread at bedtime, which is something not really recommended, in the evening I did a 5-mile exercise at the beginning as I usually do.
</p>
<p>
This time I did the usual workout only that I dropped a run with the walk, which
means I ran 20 seconds and walked 20 seconds and again I ran and that way at least
20 times. It was hard but I feel it saves me the time of cardio at home.
</p>
<p>
Then I came home and did a pullup, these are the workouts that are supposed
to strengthen my back, it was very difficult for me even though a week before
I had a slow drop from the bar every day, I still went up to the bar and still
it until half or quarter.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day I gained more than 2kg this weekend. I hope to return to
93.4kg and continue the drop to 92kg if not 91kg.
</p>



Good night.
