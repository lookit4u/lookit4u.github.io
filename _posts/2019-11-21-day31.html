<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.1kg</h2>
<p>
So my weight is almost back to what it was last week, I continue to eat cosmine bread with tuna every night and tuna with hard boiled eggs, and during the day I eat salad and some tuna, all day only tuna, tuna, tuna. it's not easy to be simple.
</p>
<p>
During my work as I have written before, I do not do too much physical activity so tonight I will have to do a minimum of walking. It's cold outside, so you have to dress warm today and just go out for a workout.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully tomorrow I can update that my weight has dropped completely at least to the weight I was last week.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
