I won't say I was in shock, but it was cool to see my success after yesterday's hard work.
Doing cardio with the additional of walking a 5km distance probably really adds to the workout
and maybe I will continue to do so in the coming days..
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 95.3kg</h2>


<p>
I lost a whole 1kg (which is 2.204 pounds) during the night, which is amazing. If it continues at such a
pace I will be able to reach the weight I want over the weekend which is 91.8kg. It will be difficult,
no doubt, but at this rate it is possible.
</p>


<p>
On the evening I went out for walking, again I done 5km which is 2.5 far from home and 2.5 back to home,
after I finish I checked what is the Bar Brothers traning for thast day, on the table was written to do chest
workout, so I run for it, I must say that it was realy hard for me, on chest workout you can find pushup in several
positions, I done every position at least 4 sets.

<span class="caption text-muted">It's not easy to do a 5km walk or run every day

<p>
  I ate my regular dinner, the one I always eat after a workout only this time I added a little vegetable
  salad. I drank a few glasses of water and then got ready to sleep. Tomorrow is a new day and I hope to
  find out in the morning that I lost weight again, just like yesterday. The thing is that I didn't do cardio
  today so I don't know what will be. But I hope I will lose weight again.

<p>
  I may also not lose weight because of the massive workout that I have done, I know that muscle is heavier than
  fat, so if my muscle mass has increased then I'm not sure I'll see the results I expect to see when I will
  get on the weight meterfor tomorrow. But I still need such hope to get caught up on her.

Cheers!
