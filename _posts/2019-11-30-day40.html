<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.2kg</h2>
<p>
  So I was really gaining weight, but that won't stop me from dropping in the next week, I hope the drop continues at this rate as we saw this week, this way I can guarantee a maximum drop in the coming month.
</p>
<p>
  I have a lot to work out this week and eat healthy, I am currently addicted to tuna and salad is rich in many ingredients, I feel really good about myself, and it is fun to be that way.</p>
</p>
<p>
Good night.
