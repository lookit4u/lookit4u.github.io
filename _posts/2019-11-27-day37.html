subtitle: "Progress this week isn't really on the horizon, but I'm sure
the 40-day honor will be change or at least progress. I do everything I
can, whether it's training or maintaining the diet and the
first 40 days are the main influencer on my body."

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.3kg</h2>
<p>
  Today Wednesday, my weight has been on the same index for two days, but I continued to eat what I was allowed to eat and do, I have to change my training order, do some exercise from a Bar Brothers table and then rest for a day or two.
</p>
<p>
  For a weekend, I'm going to do a walk that includes runs, at least that's how I plan.</p>
</p>
<p>
Good night.
