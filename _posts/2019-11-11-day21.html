<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 94.0kg</h2>

<p>
  So today I weighed myself in the morning, I saw that my weight was back to being
  just like last Friday (8.11.19). The feeling was good. But today I must not be hungry
  like yesterday and so yesterday as I said I made green beans, it looks very good and
  the smell of it is
  amazing.
<p>
</p>
  Today I decided to show all the tables so far,
  I started training on Tuesday and so today (Monday) I close a
  3 week cycle. Not just exercising every day but the results are
  not too late to come, I think the Bar Brothers program is great for me,
  and I really see results fast and now more than ever because my weight has
   returned to being very fast what it was a week ago.
</p>

<p>
</p>
The first table shows that there is a drop from 98.3 and a relatively
steep decline for the other graphs shown here, everywhere in the other
mid-weight shows, this is the weekend when I dropped a bit of exercise
and ate a little beyond what
I was supposed to eat.

The second table shows that there is a little jump before the weekend
and that is because I brought to the restaurant in the evening, although
I did not eat leftovers from forbidden things, it was salad with tuna, but
there were some potatoes and this has a relatively sharp effect before bed.
After the weekend my weight jumped again and this time I gained weight to 96 kg.

</p>
In the third table the beginning of the week started with a moderate drop
and then again a sharp jump over the weekend, but note, this is almost 2kg
 more than I had in the weeks before that, after which I lost weight
 quite quickly to the weight I had on November 8th.

<p>
It is best to see that there is a steady pace, a fall that I have on weekends and
that I eat more than usual, but even if you fell down, if you give up then you
lose everything. You have to go ahead and stop the program in the middle. At the
moment, the results are brewing at a good pace. In another 20 days we will know
exactly what the situation is and a comparison of pictures before and after.

In addition, after a month, the waist and arms should be checked and abdomen
and pelvis,

Good night.
