subtitle: "So at the beginning of the week there was a slight decrease,
and then I stayed for days on the same weight, guess what, I'm on the same weight again,
it's very interesting why it happens."

<h2 class="section-heading">Weight - 93.3kg</h2>
<p>
I'm pretty wacky that my weight stays the same weight, but on the other hand every week I drop about half a pound off the weight, maybe a little more, so tomorrow I might see at least half a pound.</p>
<p>
So true, I did not go down this week as much as I wanted to, but there is still time or at least one day until I do another check on my weight, which means after a weekend I will test how much I lost, if at all, and in my opinion lost at least half a pound or more. Although it doesn't look that way right now.

Good night.
